# Air Quality Measure based on AQI

- An air quality index (AQI) is used by government agencies to communicate to the public how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become. Public health risks increase as the AQI rises. 

- There are six AQI categories, namely Good, Satisfactory, Moderately polluted, Poor, Very Poor, and Severe. The proposed AQI will consider eight pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, NH3, and Pb) for which short-term (up to 24-hourly averaging period) National Ambient Air Quality Standards are prescribed.

- Based on the measured ambient concentrations, corresponding standards and likely health impact, a sub-index is calculated for each of these pollutants. The worst sub-index reflects overall AQI. Likely health impacts for different AQI categories and pollutants have also been suggested, with primary inputs from the medical experts in the group. 

## About The Project

- In this project we mainly focused on cleaning of data and tried to interpret various conclusions and visualisations from the collected data by using various libraries.

- We tried to visualise the yearly data of every pollutant, tried to find the most polluted and the least polluted city based on the data - station wise as well as city wise.

- At last we worked on a hypothesis testing, which works around the quality of air before and after COVID-19.

#### The Following steps are followed for our analysis:
- Data Collection
- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Data Visualization
- Data Statistics
- Data Interpretation
- Hypothesis Testing
- Prediction
